## üìö Documentation

This code is a demo of the paper [A Parallel Feature-preserving Mesh Variable Offsetting Approach Based On Dynamic Programming]().

It can be use to calculate the offset result of a mesh.

This demo only have the code which working in manifold meshes.

Use the mesh kernel which built by [intelligent visual modeling & simulation lab](https://igame.hdu.edu.cn) in Hangzhou
Dianzi University

This code can be built in Linux and MacOS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

### Linux
The version of g++ must later than 12.0. We test the g++-7.2, it can't compile successfully.

cgal version must be larger than 5.5.
```bash
sudo su root
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install libcgal-dev 
apt install libeigen3-dev 
apt install libgflags-dev 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osqp/osqp

## Usage:

```bash

USAGE: PFPOffset -f file_name [options]              file_name is *.obj or *.obj2      
options:
  -m={1|2}        mode 1 get the result with from ftetwild;
                    mode 2 get the result without from tetwild;
                    
  -l=<num>          This number is a double.
                    which value indicates how many times the maximum offset distance is the ideal offset distance.
                    You can set it is 1.5 or do not set it.
                    
  -s=<num>          This number is a double.
                    which value indicates how many times the minimum offset distance is the ideal offset distance.
                    You can set it is 1.0 or do not set it. You need to ensure that the value of -s is less than -l.
                    
  -t=<num>          This number is a integer represent thread num please set this value depend the number of cpu cores of you device.
  
  -i={1|2}          representing running mode which value can be chose in 1,2. 
                    1 is offsetting to the outside of the mesh;
                    2 is offsetting to the inside of the mesh.
                    

  -d=<num>          The absolute distance for offset. If you want to perform variable offset, please do not use this parameter, but use the obj2 file.

  -L=<num>           set tetwild argument -l;
  -E=<num>           set tetwild argument -e;



                    
example:
./PFPOffset  -f ../data/mechanical04.obj -i=2 -t=8       
./PFPOffset  -f ../data/tet.obj2 -i=1 -t=8 
```


### The input file format

If you want to do invariable offset. You can use the obj file than set the expect distance by setting the argument -d.

If you want to do variable offset, you should use the obj2 format.

obj2 format which is same as *.obj. But in the end line of each face, it needs to add a double representing the ideal offsetting value.


example: tet.obj2
```text
v 0 0 0
v 1 0 0
v 0 1 0
v -1 -1 1
f 1 3 2 0.05
f 1 4 3 0.04
f 2 4 1 0.03
f 2 3 4 0.02

```

### NOTE:

cgal version must be larger than 5.5

If you want to do not use this program for Offset with long offset distance, this program will not have a fast speed.
You need to wait a lot of time before the program finishes running.

### KNOWN ISSUES:

In extremely rare cases, there will be problems with cgal allocating memory under multiple threads. On devices with sufficient memory, this phenomenon does not occur frequently.
So it can be solved by re-running at present.
